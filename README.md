📌 Project Overview

The AI Face Emotion Detection HUD detects and tracks human emotions in real time. It focuses on five core emotions: angry, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.
The system is optimized for smooth performance by analyzing frames at fixed time intervals instead of every frame.

This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision, deep learning, and real-time visualization.
